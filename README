The Shell Toolkit (shtk) is an application toolkit for programmers
writing POSIX-compliant shell scripts.

shtk provides a collection of reusable modules that work on a wide
variety of operating systems and shell interpreters.  The included
modules aid developers in implementing usable and consistent CLI
interfaces, interacting with processes, parsing configuration files and
manipulating higher-level data types among other things.

shtk-based scripts are "built" by using the included shtk(1) utility,
which adds the necessary machinery to the scripts so that they can
trivially import and use the modular interfaces of shtk.

shtk is known to be compatible with at least bash, dash, pdksh and zsh,
and continuous integration tests on Travis CI prove this to be the case.
It is also true that shtk runs on other shells like the native /bin/sh
interpreter of the BSD systems but, unfortunately, no assurances are
made in this regard by the continuous integration system.
