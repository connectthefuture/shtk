Changes in version 1.5
======================

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.

* Added timeout support to shtk_process_run.  The new '-t' option to
  this function takes the number of seconds before forcibly killing the
  subprocess.


Changes in version 1.4
======================

Released on 2013-12-30.

* Added support for a user-defined SHTK_MODULESPATH variable.  This
  colon-separated, user-tunable variable lists the directories that
  contain modules.

* Added a modulesdir variable to shtk.pc so that third-party packages
  can install shtk-compliant modules into the shared directory.  This
  variable is also exposed by the SHTK_CHECK macro of shtk.m4 as
  SHTK_MODULESDIR.

* Added a new bool module with a shtk_bool_check function to convert a
  string to a boolean.

* Added a new cleanup module to simplify the installation and automatic
  execution of termination handlers.

* Fixed the config module in Mac OS X 10.9 to respect default values
  of configuration variables.


Changes in version 1.3
======================

Released on 2013-07-28.

* Sources migrated to a GitHub project from the previous copy in
  the pkgsrc repository.  shtk is now a first-class package and includes
  a traditional build system based on automake and autoconf and also
  provides a pkg-config file and autoconf macros to ease the integration
  with other packages.


Changes in version 1.2
======================

Released on 2013-06-18.

* Properly propagate errors returned by cvs checkout and cvs update.
  Problem reported by Nathan Arthur in private mail.


Changes in version 1.1
======================

Released on 2013-03-08.

* Added the shtk_config_run_hook function to invoke a hook in the context
  of a configuration file.


Changes in version 1.0
======================

Released on 2012-08-15.

* This is the first release of the shtk package.  The sources were
  located in the pkgsrc repository and shtk was only available as a
  pkgsrc package.
