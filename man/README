This directory contains the shtk API reference.  The following conventions
apply:

* There shall be one shtk_<module>_<function>(3) page per public function,
  describing the function's purpose, arguments and return values.

* Each shtk_<module>_<function>(3) page shall be linked from the
  corresponding shtk_<module>(3) page and viceversa.

* There shall be one shtk_<module>(3) page per module, describing what
  the module is about.

* All shtk_*(3) page shall link to shtk(3).

* All shtk_<module>(3) pages shall be linked from the shtk(3) page.

* The base module is an exception and does not have an shtk_base(3) manual
  page.  The reason for this is that base is loaded unconditionally so the
  user never knows that such module exists.

These guidelines are intended to let the user navigate the documentation as
follows: shtk(3) -> pick a module -> see shtk_<module>(3) for all its
functions -> pick a function -> see shtk_<module>_<function>(3).
