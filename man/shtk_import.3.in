.Dt SHTK_IMPORT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm shtk_import
.Nd Loads an shtk module
.Sh LIBRARY
Built-in function; automatically loaded.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function imports the shtk module specified by
.Ar module
into the currently-running script.
Requests to import a module are idempotent, so it is acceptable to import
the same module multiple times.
.Pp
Modules are first searched for in the collection of directories provided by
the user in the colon-separated environment variable
.Va SHTK_MODULESPATH .
If this variable is not defined, or if the module is not found in any of
the specified directories, then the built-in directory
.Pa __SHTK_MODULESDIR__
is used.
.Pp
Because shell scripts have no namespaces, an import of a module makes the
module available script-wide regardless of where the import happens.
Therefore, it is possible for an import of a module to import other
modules, and for those indirectly-imported modules to be visible in your
script.
Good programming practice dictates that you should not rely on these
implicit imports and always explicitly declare all the modules you use.
.Sh ERRORS
The requested module must exist so
.Nm
aborts execution if the module is not present.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Va SHTK_MODULESDIR
Overrides the built-in location of the modules.
Defaults to
.Pa __SHTK_MODULESDIR__ .
.It Va SHTK_MODULESPATH
Colon-separated list of directories in which to look for modules.
.Va SHTK_MODULESDIR
is always implied at the end of the path.
The user can define this variable to point to other directories.
This is especially handy in packages that install custom modules and want to
use such modules before installing them.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa __SHTK_MODULESDIR__/
Location of the built-in
.Nm
modules.
