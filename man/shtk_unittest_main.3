.Dt SHTK_UNITTEST_MAIN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm shtk_unittest_main
.Nd Standard test program entry point
.Sh LIBRARY
shtk_import unittest
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function implements the standard entry point of a test program that uses the
.Xr shtk_unittest 3
library.
The
.Nm
function runs all test cases registered within the test case and determines
the correct exit condition for the test program.
.Pp
In order to use
.Nm ,
test programs must either explicitly call the function from their
.Nm main
method as this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
main() { shtk_unittest_main "${@}"; }
.Ed
.Pp
Or the test program can be compiled with an override for the main method's
name:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ shtk build -m shtk_unittest_main module_test.sh
.Ed
.Pp
In general, prefer the latter mechanism.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns 0 (true) if all executed test cases pass, or 1 (false) if any
test fails.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr shtk 3 ,
.Xr shtk_unittest 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nm shtk
